## Technical Background

I started programming a little bit in high school when I took AP Computer Science principles, however I really became interested in programming my freshman year of college when I took an applied coding class for engineers. I eventually switched my major from CE to CS, and have since worked with basic embedded systems in C, learned Python, and done some basic projects in both. I also had an internship over the summer where I wrote web applications using ReactJS, NextJS, and google cloud firestore.
